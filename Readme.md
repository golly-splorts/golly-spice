# gollyx-spice

Re-simulating every Golly match, with better instrumentation.

Scripts to run simulations of prior games are in the `scripts/` directory.

Snakemake workflows to run simulations are in the `snakemake/` directory.

We will haver lots of files, they may get large, so figure out a disk/buckets strategy.
